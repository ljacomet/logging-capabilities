WARNING: This plugin has been merged with the GradleX https://github.com/gradlex-org/jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution[jvm-dependency-conflict-resolution] plugin.
Please update to that other plugin and report issues there.
I will follow up on the existing issues here and move the relevant ones to the new plugin.

Ever seen this infamous Slf4J warning?

[source]
----
SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../slf4j-log4j12-1.7.29.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:.../logback-classic-1.2.3.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.
SLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]

Ever wondered how to make sure _all_ your dependencies' logging ends up in your Log4J 2 configuration?

Then this plugin is for you!

It is built on the https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/userguide/component_capabilities.html[Gradle capabilities feature], to detect and optionally select a Java logger implementation so that it is enforced at build time!

== Plugin application and compatibility

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
  id("dev.jacomet.logging-capabilities") version "0.11.0"
}
----

Have a look at https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/dev.jacomet.logging-capabilities[the documentation on the plugin portal] for alternate or DSL specific syntax.

|===
| Gradle version | Available feature

| Gradle 5.0+
| The detection part is available

| Gradle 6.0+
| The configuration part is available

| Gradle 8.0+
| All features available, requires version 0.11.0 or above of the plugin

|===

== Detection of invalid logging configurations

Upon application, this plugin defines a set of https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/userguide/component_metadata_rules.html#basics_of_writing_a_component_metadata_rule[component metadata rules] that add capabilities to relevant logging related dependencies.
The added capabilities and impacted modules can be found in the table below:

|===
| Capability | Impacted modules | Comment

| `slf4j-impl`
| `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`, `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl`
| Represents an Slf4J binding

| `log4j2-impl`
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`
| Represents the native Log4J 2 implementation or delegation to Slf4J

| `log4j2-vs-slf4j`
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j`
| Represents the Slf4J / Log4J 2 relationship: which one delegates to the other

| `slf4j-vs-log4j`
| `org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`
| Represents the Slf4J / Log4J 1.2 relationship: either Slf4J intercepts or binds to Log4J

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-log4j`
| `org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-1.2-api`, `log4j:log4j`
| Represents the available Log4J implementation: native, with Slf4J or with Log4J 2

| `slf4j-vs-jul`
| `org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`
| Represents the Slf4J / `java.util.logging` relationship: either Slf4 intercepts or binds to JUL

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-jul`
| `org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jul`
| Represents JUL replacement: either with Slf4J or with Log4J 2

| `commons-logging-impl`
| `commons-logging:commons-logging`, `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.springframework:spring-jcl`
| Represents Apache Commons Logging implementation: native or Slf4J

| `slf4j-vs-jcl`
| `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`
| Represents the Slf4J / Apache Commons Logging relationship: either Slf4J intercepts or binds to `commons-logging`

| `slf4j-vs-log4j2-jcl`
| `org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j`, `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jcl`
| Represents the Slf4J or Log4J 2 interception of `commons-logging`

|===

TIP: All capabilities are in the group `dev.jacomet.logging`

With the set of capabilities defined above, all configuration resolutions in Gradle will fail if conflicting modules are found in the graph.

== Alignment of logging libraries

In addition to the capability setting and conflict detection, the plugin also registers https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/userguide/dependency_version_alignment.html#sec:align-versions-virtual[alignment rules] for Slf4J and Log4J 2 modules.

Due to a bug in Gradle versions `[5.2, 6.2[`, alignment is disabled by default for these versions.
Users with Gradle `[6.0, 6.2[` can opt back in with `loggingCapabilities.enableAlignment()`.
Note that enabling alignment for these versions may cause some capabilities conflict to remain undetected.
See https://github.com/ljacomet/logging-capabilities/issues/4[this issue] for details.

== Expressing preference over a logging solution

The plugin also contributes a project extension that allows to configure which logging solution to use in a declarative fashion.
This solution is https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/userguide/dependency_capability_conflict.html#sub:selecting-between-candidates[based on APIs] introduced in Gradle 6.0.

The extension is accessed as follows:

[source,kotlin]
----
// Assuming the plugin has been applied
loggingCapabilities {
    // Configuration goes here
}
----

TIP: The different configuration options documented below do not _add_ dependencies.
Make sure to have the expected dependency in your graph, either as a direct or transitive one.

The plugin first provides a number of high-level, one stop solutions, for selecting a logging solution:

|===
| Method | Documentation | Required dependency

| `enforceLogback()` +
  `enforceLogback(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of http://logback.qos.ch/[LOGBack] and route all alternative logging solutions through Slf4J.
| `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic`

| `enforceLog4J2()` +
  `enforceLog4J2(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4J 2] and route all alternative logging solutions through Log4J 2.
| `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`

| `enforceSlf4JSimple()` +
  `enforceSlf4JSimple(String configurationName)`
| This will configure all capabilities to resolve in favour of Slf4J simple and route all alternative logging solutions through Slf4J.
| `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`

|===

TIP: The method without parameter will apply the setup to all dependency configuration, while the other one will limit the setup to the specified dependency configuration.

If you want a finer grained control, the plugin provides lower level entry points for solving the different logging capability conflicts:
|===
| Method | Accepted parameter values | Documentation

| `selectSlf4JBinding(Object notation)`
| Value must be an Slf4J binding implementation known by the plugin: `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jcl`, `org.slf4j:slf4j-jdk14`, `ch.qos.logback:logback-classic` or `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j-impl`

|===

TIP: Notations above are those accepted by https://docs.gradle.org/6.0.1/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler:create(java.lang.Object)[`DependencyHandler.create(notation)`] in Gradle that resolves to an `ExternalDependency`.
Most often this is a `group:name:version` `String`.
